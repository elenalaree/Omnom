# Overview
Omnom, the recipe app. 

I made this as a Kotlin entry level project to test my skill. Its purpose is to create a place to store recipes.

The software I wrote allows a user to add a recipe, retrieve that recipe, and remove it.

I wanted to make an app where my family could share recipes togeether.
